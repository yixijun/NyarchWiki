## Projects description
In this section you can find some exploration about the projects and some software, library etc. that might accelerate development.

For every project, this is listed:

- **Goals**: what the project wants to achieve
- **Requiremets**: the requirements the project must have to be released. `(secondary)` requirements can be implemented with updates after release.
- **Exploration**: software that might accelerate the development, experiments... 
- **Tasks**: Required tasks to create the project 

### KDE Plasma Spin
#### Goals

1. Offer a new desktop spin that still follows Nyarch Principles
2. Make Nyarch a considerable distribution for those who hate Gnome
3. Cover a bigger distribution of desktop preference thanks to KDE customization
4. Convert Nyarch applications to Kirigami in order to keep consistency
#### Requirements

1. Material UwU principle must be followed
2. Nyarch extra applications should feel coherent in KDE version, likely be rewritten with Kirigami
3. The distro must have all the important KDE packages for desktop use, but not too much bloat

#### Exploration

**R1** can be followed thanks to [KDE Material You colors](https://github.com/luisbocanegra/kde-material-you-colors) and to [Adwaita Material You](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/adwaita-material-you/) for GTK application theming.

The following screenshots can be a point of reference for this implementation:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5530f89-0fc9-46b5-bf05-c80c8e1578d4)

GTK applications and KDE applications still doesn't feel perfectly coherent, but they don't feel out of place. An early release with GTK applications is possible.

Because it's cool, we will also add [Geometry Change](https://store.kde.org/p/2136283/)

### Hyprland spin
#### Goals

1. Offer a new desktop spin that still follows Nyarch Principles
2. Make Nyarch a considerable distribution for users who love tiling WM
3. Hyprland is very cool so Nyarch version cool
4. Offer a Nyarch Spin with more cool animations and eyecandy
5. Deeper integrated weeb software

#### Requirements

1. Material UwU principle must be followed
2. It must be stable enough, without too much breaking
3. Layout switcher for not so advanced users (optional)
3. Must be simple for not so advanced users (optional)
4. Find or create suitable dotfiles

#### Exploration

**R1** can be followed thanks to [Adwaita Material You](https://github.com/FrancescoCaracciolo/adwaita-material-you/) for GTK application theming. Also with pywal etc we can theme other elements of the UI.

For possible dotfiles, we have multiple possibilities:
##### dots-hyprland

![315949766-711f5475-93ca-4097-a960-8047acc85cc7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3c3c6de-d0f3-443e-a846-df7cd46f9de3)


[end-4's dots-hyprland](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) has a lot of features that perfectly align with Nyarch principles:

- Material You theming (**R1**)
- Good looking
- A ton of features
- Weeb stuff
- AI chat integrated

However, there are these issues:

- Ton of dependencies
- Custom packages to build
- Very likely to break over time

##### HyprYou


![](https://github.com/koeqaife/hyprland-material-you/blob/v2/assets/screenshot.png?raw=true)

[HyprYou](https://github.com/koeqaife/hyprland-material-you) is a very complete configuration that respect **R1** and doesn't have a lot of dependencies.
Also, it is packaged without touching the user's home directory, which makes it better to implement.
##### LinkFRG Dotfiles

![](https://github.com/linkfrg/dotfiles/raw/main/assets/4.png)

[linkfrg dotfiles](https://github.com/linkfrg/dotfiles/) are a very good options. Unlike the previous, it uses Ignis and not some old version of AGS, thus making it easier to maintain, more powerful, and easy to extend. Also, dependencies aren't many. It does lack some features compared to those above for now.

##### Custom dotfiles
Most complex option. This requires basically programming a DE. gtk_layer_shell might be a good friend for this. 

If anyone wants to do it and can do it well I'm not stopping him.

#### Tasks

| Task | Description | Status | Complexity | Further information | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Creating a ISO with Hyprland | Create a Nyarch ISO with required Hyprland packages and make it bootable and installable | TODO | Simple |  | Critical |
| Do everything else | Idk decision still have to be made lol | TODO | Complex |  | Critical |
| Website update | Update the website to support multiple spins | TODO | Complex |  | Critical |

### Nyarch Assistant Desktop Puppet
#### Goals

1. Display a Live2D model (arch-chan by default) on the desktop
2. Easy interaction with Nyarch Assistant
3. Keep company for alone Nyarch users
4. Look cool
5. Having a desktop mate and create a substitution for Desktop Mate for Linux
#### Requirements 
1. The model integrates with Nyarch Assistant
2. You can interact with the model, move it around
3. With some interactions with the model, some animations play (optional)
4. The model follows the mouse movement with the eyes
5. You can easily adjust the layer in which the model is
6. Working with Nyarch desktop spins
7. It can be run easily out of Nyarch
#### Exploration
A small amount of code has been written using gtk_layer_shell to check that this is actually possible.
This is the result:

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16018382-5134-45c7-9c64-02f4922dc152" controls=true></video>


This uses gtk_layer_shell to display a transparent webview with the model. After that, it resizes the click area to the model position and size.

The following of the cursor is done by polling the mouse position (10FPS in the demo) and making the live2d model focus it. The current implementation only works on Hyprland, but can also be done on KDE Plasma.
GTK Layer shell currently is **not supported on Gnome**, but it can likely be implemented with almost same code with an extension.

#### Tasks
| Task | Description | Status | Complexity | Further information | Criticality |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Correctly resize the model | At the moment the model size is not handled perfectly and does not adapt to any monitor resolution | TODO | Simple |  | Critical |
| Support for KDE Plasma | Support KDE mouse movement and KDE monitors | Partial | Simple  | | Critical |
| Better Hyprland support | Support for hyprland monitors | Done | Simple |  | Critical |
| Support Gnome | Add Gnome support, which require a custom extension | Partial | Medium |  | Critical |
| Add model interactions | Add abilities to interact with the model and show animations | TODO | Medium |  | Critical |
| Integration with Nyarch Assistant | The model must connect with Nyarch Assistant | Done | Medium |  | Critical |
| Add screenshot capability with Nyarch Assistant | The model can take a screenshot of the screen to help the user (obv if prompted and allowed) | Done | Simple |  | Critical |
| Add some idle animations | The model moves around and does thing on your desktop | TODO | Complex |  | Optional |
| Website update | Update the website to list this feature | TODO | Simple |  | Critical |

Development phase: in an early development phase, we can ship a Nyarch Assistant extension in order to receive feedback from users

### Better AI Intergation

This feature has been rejected through polling. It will not be implemented.

#### Goals

1. Simplify interaction with Nyarch Assistant AI
2. Add quality of life improvements using LLM

Other goals are welcome. 
#### Requirements

TBD

#### Exploration

##### Quick Chat access
We can fork or collaborate with [Penguin AI Chatbot for Gnome](https://gitlab.com/martijara/Penguin-AI-Chatbot-for-GNOME) to provide on the fly chat access with Nyarch Assistant. 
For Hyprland and KDE version, similar approaches can be done.

##### Writing assistant
We can implement a writing assistant to simplify Summaries, Rewrites and similar tasks.
